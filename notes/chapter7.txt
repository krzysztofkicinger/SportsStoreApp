# Making AJAX requests

**$http** - built-in service, defines methods for making different kinds of Ajax request

### Types of method calls
 * synchronous - execution doesn't move on to the next statement until the current one has been completed
 * asynchronous - Ajax request is a regular HTTP request that happens asynchronously (in the background), AngularJS represents asynchronous operations using **promises**

### $http.get

Starts Ajax requests and execution of the application continues, even though the request has yet to be completed. Returns an object that defines:
 * success(function(data) { ... })
 * error(function(error) { ... })
Passed functions to those methods takes arguments and AngulaJS promises to call one of them to tell me how the request turns out.

**Note**: AngularJS provides automatic conversion that performs for JSON data.

### Dealing with errors

Good solution is to enable visibility of some elements if error happens or not
 * **ng-show directive** - hides the element it applied to until the expression specified in the attribute value evaluates to true
 * **ng-hide directive** - hides the element as long as the attribute value evaluates to true

**Error object** passed by AngularJS to error(function (**error**) { ... }) defines properties:
 * **status** - HTTP error code
 * **property** - string that describes the problem

# Partial Views

**ng-include directive** - import files (views) at runtime to the current view

```js
<ng-include src="'./views/productList.html'"></ng-include>
```

The name of the file is specified as literal value in single quotes. If it was not, then the directive would look for a scope property to get the name of the file.

### Benefits of partial views
 * Breaks the application into manageable chunks
 * Creates fragments of HTML that can be used repeatedly in an application
 * Different areas of functionality can be shown easier

# Services

AngularJS provides a lot of functionality through **services** (they are simply singleton objects that are accessible throughout an application.

There are different ways of creating a service, one of them is Module.factory:

```js
angular.module("<moduleName>", [])
    .factory("<serviceName>", function() {
        return {
            ... JavaScript Object ...
        }
    });
```

Passed arguments to factory(...) function:
 * <serviceName>
 * Factory Function - will be invoked when AngularJS needs the service, responsible for creating the service object, will be called **only once**

# Directives

**Directives* - self-contained, reusable units of functionality, directives allow you to write anything from simple helpers to complex features and to decide whether the result is rightly woven into the current application or completely reusable in other applications

### Creating Directives

```js
angular.module("<moduleName>", [])
    .directive("<directiveName>", function(cart) {
        return {
                ... JavaScript Object...
            }
        });
```

Factory Function:
 * Returns a **Directive definition object**
 * This object defines properties that tells AngularJS what directive does and how it does it
  * restrict - how the directive can be applied (E - directive can be applied ONLY as element, EA - directive can be applied as an element or attribute)
  * templateUrl - URL of partial view whose contents will be inserted into the directive's element
  * controller - controller object

# URL Navigation

**URL Routing** - allows partial views to be displayed automatically based on the current URL

### Defining URL Routes

**Route** - mapping between specific URL and the view that should be displayed when browser navigates to that URL

1. Add **angular-route.js** file as script to the main app page

```html
<script src="./frameworks/angular-1.3.14/angular-route.js"></script>
```

2. Add **ngRoute** module as dependency, to module which will be responsible for routing

```js
angular.module("<moduleName>", ["ngRoute", ...])
```

3. Define entries for routing inside the **config(..)** method:

```js
.config(function ($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider.when("<urlPath>", {
        templateUrl : "<partialViewPath>"
    });
    $routeProvider.otherwise({
        templateUrl : "<defaultPath>"
    });
});
```

Example:

```js
$routeProvider.when("/checkout", {
    templateUrl : "./views/checkoutSummary.html"
});
```

**config(..) method** - config method takes function as its argument, which is executed when the module is loaded but before the application is executed, providing opportunity for any one-off configuration tasks

**$routeProvider** - provider object of **$route service** used to set up the URL routing in an application
 * **when("<urlPath>", "<object>") - matches URL to the view
 * **otherwise("<object>") - specifies the view that should be used when the URL doesn't match one of those

### URL Routes

URL routes are matched against the **path** section (**#<path>**)

4. Add **<ng-view />** in the place where partial view should be displayed.

**<ng-view /> directive** is used to tell AngularJS where to display partial views. It is defined in the **ngRoute**

### Using URL Routing to navigate

```js
<a href="#/checkout" ..>Click here</a>
```

# Common Errors:

1. Problem - Unknown provider

```
Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: dataUrlProvider <- dataUrl <- sportsStoreController
```

Solution 1 - Check constant name and function parameter

```js
angular.module("sportsStoreApp")
    .constant("dataURL", "http://localhost:5050/products")
    .controller("sportsStoreController", function($scope, $http, dataUrl) {
        ...
    });
```

Problem here is caused by dataURL - dataUrl mismatch. You need to change **dataUrl** function parameter to **dataURL**.

Solution 2 - Check whether module dependencies have been applied

```js
angular.module('myApp', ['myApp.directives', 'myApp.services']);
```
